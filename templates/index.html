                    Are you are deailing with some kind of difficult painful problem? 
                </h2><p>
                    If so, you have probably been told to exercise, but you may have found that exercising in a way that doesn't make you hurt more can be challenging. 
                </p><p>
                    I am a physical therapist and many of my clients have had bad experiences or recieved bad advice about how to approach exercise in the presence of pain.
                </p><p>
                    Many have tried traditional fitness approaches, but have been frustrated by lack of progress and hurting more. However I have found that changing the approach to incorporate modern pain science principles can make a big difference. 
                </p><p>
                    If you are curious what a pain science approach to exercise looks like, join Movement Over Pain to get a free email mini-course on how a pain science approach to exercise is different than traditional fitness and how it can help you finally improve your fitness without hurting more.
