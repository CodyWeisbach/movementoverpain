                    Are you are deailing with some kind of difficult painful problem? 
                </h2><p>        
                    If so, I'm betting that you have been told that exercise can be helpful, but have found that getting it right can be challenging. I am wondering what types of exercise you have tried, if they were helpful, or if you are either afraid to start or tried and stopped because it made you hurt more?
                </p><p>
                    I ask because I am a physical therapist and I have found that many of my clients have had bad experiences or recieved bad advice about how to approach exercise in the presence of pain. I have found that I've been able to help them so I'm thinking of doing something to try and help more people. 
                </p><p>
                    Anything you could share with me would be helpful! 
                </p>

                        <input type='submit' class='btn btn-primary' value='Let me know!' />
                    </form> 
                <p>
